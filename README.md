# photo_album_backbone_freelance

A small java project aimed to provide a backbone for a photo album app. 
This project was completed for a freelance job. 

It features a custom made data structure implementation, that mimics a Java LinkedList in most ways.
Implemented a system that sorts photos in albums according to tags that the application attaches to them.
